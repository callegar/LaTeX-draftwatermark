The "draftwatermark" package extends LaTeX providing a means to add a
textual, light gray watermark on every page or on the first page of a
document. Typical usage may consist in writing words such as "DRAFT"
or "CONFIDENTIAL" across document pages. The package may remind in
some sense "draftcopy" by Dr. Juergen Vollmer, but its implementation
is much lighter (as the reduced code footprint shows) and does not
rely on postscript specials, making the package fully compatible with
pdfLaTeX. The package depends on package "everypage" by the same
author.
